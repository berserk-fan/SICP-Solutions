;; Exercise 2.54.  Two lists are said to be equal? if they contain equal elements arranged in the same order. For example,

;; (equal? '(this is a list) '(this is a list))

;; is true, but

;; (equal? '(this is a list) '(this (is a) list))

;; is false. To be more precise, we can define equal? recursively in terms of the basic eq? equality of symbols by saying that a and b are equal? if they are both symbols and the symbols are eq?, or if they are both lists such that (car a) is equal? to (car b) and (cdr a) is equal? to (cdr b). Using this idea, implement equal? as a procedure.36

(define (equal? list1 list2)
  (cond ((or (number? list1)
	     (number? list))
	 (eq? list1 list2))

	 (AND (eq? list1 '())
	      (eq? list2 '())))
        ((AND (pair? (car list1))
	      (pair? (car list2))) (AND (equal? (car list1)
						(car list2))
					(equal? (cdr list1)

;; Exercise 2.64.  The following procedure list->tree converts an ordered list to a balanced binary tree. The helper procedure partial-tree takes as arguments an integer n and list of at least n elements and constructs a balanced tree containing the first n elements of the list.

;;a. Write a short paragraph explaining as clearly as you can how partial-tree works. Draw the tree produced by list->tree for the list (1 3 5 7 9 11).
;;Answer: It is correct by definition and fact that we reduce problem on each step.

;;b. What is the order of growth in the number of steps required by list->tree to convert a list of n elements?;
;;Answer: O(n). This can be checked in two parts:
;; 1: runtime doesn't depend on size of elts.
;; 2: T(m,n) = T(m,n/2) + T(m/2, n/2) where m is size of elts and (1) gives us T(n) = 2T(n/2) which gives up T(n) = O(n).
